## Homework 7

1. Testing should occur throughout every stage of the construction process. This allows the designer to verify their actions and prevent mistakes. 
2. Verification is for determining a specific workflow has been correctly carried out while validation occurs before the software is handed to the recepient to confirm all requirements are met. 
3. Non-Execution based testing comprises things like reviewing code line by line and all forms of testing outside of actual execution. Execution based testing are the tests we typically think of invloving running the software. 
4. Quality in software quality assurance refers to ensuring the given software properly meets all of the specified requirements. I would think it would also imply that not only the requirements are met, but they're of a particular standard of quality i.e. well documented, not convoluted, etc. 
5. The clearest advantage of the separation to me is that the other group has a fresh view of the software. This also reminds me of the shuttle team where there's a healthy competition between coders and testers. The coders want to make flawless code and the testers want to scour the code for the flaws. 
6. A correctness proof is done to determine mathematically that code will produce correct results. Execution testing is done as a method of testing to determine whether the program executes correctly as well. A single execution test would not ensure code's correctness in all cases unless it was testing code with a linear path. 
7. I enjoyed this article and accept it as a well-reasoned warning against fickle programming. Particularly for these public systems that are so large, complex, and heavily depended on, it's important to make full use of the software engineering process in order to avoid potentially catastrophic cases. I like the idea of visual programming in order to be able to see the result of your code to a degree. I understand it's not applicable in all situations but I see value in more extensive varied perspectives of the result of your work.
8. I'm doubtful that there will be a software apocalypse of the kind described. I think my role is to accept software engineering and the responsibility that comes with creating vital systems. In some cases people's lives are at stake. In cases of less crucial software it's still highly advantageous to plan out software and objectively will result in a better product.
