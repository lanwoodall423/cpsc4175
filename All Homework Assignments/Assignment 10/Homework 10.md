1. The two types of planning depicted are the planning done throughout the project and the intense planning following the completion of the project's specifications. 

2. The chart shows that until the requirements are mostly determined, the uncertainty is extremely high. Even when the requirements are determined, the range is over twice what it will be in the implementation phase. Requirements and analysis make for the greatest drop in range which makes since though the drop through design and implementation is still considerable.

3. Internal cost and external cost. Internal cost is the cost to the developers. This could be the cost of labor or the cost of hardware/software needed to develop or implement the project. External costs are the costs the client will pay which could be determined based on a bid or perhaps a team could approach a business directly offering a solution.

4.  "Creation of source code is only a small part of the total software development effort." Often times the cost of research, planning, and design will be high and LOC doesn't account for that. If creating a medical program a large amount of time may need to be spent learning the applicable basics of medicine.
"It often is unclear exactly how to count lines of code. " The nuances of different languages will provide different amounts of code for the same functionality. Also not all lines take the same amount of time to write. 
"Suppose that a software developer uses a code generator, such as a report generator, a screen generator, or a graphical user interface (GUI) generator" Sections of code can be written automatically. The core of this issue is that time is not associated with lines of code.
"The number of lines of code in the final product can be determined only when the
product is completely finished" You cannot accurately estimate the lines of code for a program. There are many ways of implementing it and one couldn't determine it early enough for an estimate. 
I'd like to add that this metric encourages inconcise code. 

5. There are many Function Point Analysis formulas/standards. The idea is to sort of quantify the business functionality of a program to determine the hours or dollars it takes to produce it. This is done by considering a functionality's previous implementations. From what I see, the best formula depends on what sort of program you're analyzing. 

6. IEEE 16326 section 5.2 explains the need for references. Every document and source of information/reference must be listed with special fields for electronic sources such as version and date. The value of this is that not only is all of the necessary information centralized in the hub that is the PMP, but it gives integrity to what is claimed by the PMP similar to an academic paper. 

7. In order to create documentation for my projects more efficiently I need to think of my project more in terms of modules when planning. The completion of a single functionality/module should be accompanied by the completion of a section of documentation before continuing to the next functionality. I think it would also be value to get into the practice of writing the documentation as I write the code instead of saving it for the end. 

8. Well for one thing if they were a software engineer they would think you didn't write it because that's just bad practice. A user would also expect the developer to have taken the time to document all of the features so they can be properly paid. Who would want to do all that work and not receive credit for it?
